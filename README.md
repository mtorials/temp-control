# Temperature Control for an ceramic oven.

This is the code for a temperature control unit for an old ceramic oven. With this control unit it is possible to define temperature curves for the oven to follow. It uses a touch display as user input and logs the expected and real temperatures as a curve on the screen.

The project runs on an Arduino Mega 2560.
